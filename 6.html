    <h2>fried egg tortilla recipe</h2>
    <p>
    Fry an egg, melt the cheese, <strong>and <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/fried-egg-tortilla-recipe-7561904" target="_blank" title="fried egg tortilla">
    warm your tortilla</a> all in the <u>same</u> pan.</strong> Add your favorite toppings–like salsa, jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro, 
    and green onions–and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if you have company.

    In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.
    </p>
    <p>
    Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gently place tortilla over egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla, as one.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty, 
    about 2 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Slide tortilla and egg to a serving plate and serve warm.
